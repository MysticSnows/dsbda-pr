loc and iloc: indexing methods used to access data in a DataFrame

With loc, you can specify the row labels and column labels to retrieve specific data. It takes the following Syntax: df.loc[row_label, column_label].

iloc is an integer-based indexing method, meaning it is used to select data based on indices. Syntax: df.iloc[row_index, column_index].

# true negative, etc
Accuracy = (tn+tp)*100/(tp+tn+fp+fn) 

True +ve/-ve: assumption is same as actual
False +ve/-ve: assumption is wrong from actual

Accuracy: TP+TN/(TP + FP + FP + FN)
Precision: total +ve prediction		TP/(TP + FP)
Recall: total actual +ve		TP/(TP + FN)
F1 Score: favours classifier that has recall & precision similar
	  2*Precision*Recall/(Pre + Recall)

Each quartile represents a specific percentage of the data.

Here's the breakdown of the quartiles and their corresponding percentages:

    First Quartile (Q1): This represents the 25th percentile of the data. It divides the data into the lower 25%.
    Second Quartile (Q2): This represents the 50th percentile, which is also the median of the data. It divides the data into the lower 50% and the upper 50%.
    Third Quartile (Q3): This represents the 75th percentile of the data. It divides the data into the lower 75%.

To summarize, the quartiles divide the data into four equal parts: the lower 25%, the lower 50% (or median), the lower 75%, and the upper 25%.

traditionally there are three quartiles: the first quartile (Q1), the second quartile (Q2), and the third quartile (Q3). These quartiles divide a dataset into four equal parts, each containing approximately 25% of the data.

The first quartile (Q1) represents the 25th percentile, the second quartile (Q2) represents the 50th percentile (which is the median), and the third quartile (Q3) represents the 75th percentile.

While the terms "first quartile," "second quartile," and "third quartile" imply that there should be a fourth quartile, in practice, the fourth quartile is not commonly referred to as a separate entity. Instead, the upper 25% of the data is often referred to as the "upper quartile" or "fourth quartile" informally, but it is not part of the traditional quartile calculations.

To summarize, there are three quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3) that divide the data into four equal parts, but the term "fourth quartile" is not commonly used in statistical analysis.

Datasets: A collection of instances
Feature: A single column of data
Instance / Observation: A single row of data
Training Dataset: A dataset that we feed into our machine learning algorithm to `train
our model`
Testing Dataset: A dataset that we `use to validate the accuracy of our model` but is not
used to train the model. It may be called the validation dataset
